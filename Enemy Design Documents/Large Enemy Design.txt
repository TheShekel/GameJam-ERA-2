Health = 3
Speed = 1 (Slowest)
Formations = Singular
Fires on projectile straight forward at a rate of one every 3 second towards the player, possibly predicting where they are going to be.

The formations should be in prefabs, so we do not need to code in the shapes, simply spawn in the prefabs from off-screen.
