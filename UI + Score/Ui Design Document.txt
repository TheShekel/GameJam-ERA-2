3 icons track the player's health. 
These icons are in the top right, near where the player would be looking, and they should be "health" shaped so it is obvious that it is health.
Top left should be a scoreboard, keeping track of player score.
Each time an enemy dies, show how much score they gained in floating-fading text.
